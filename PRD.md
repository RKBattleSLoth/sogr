# Product Requirements Document: AI-Powered Social Life Information Management System

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the product requirements for an AI-powered social life information management system that serves as an intelligent "second brain" for social information. The system leverages a team of specialized Large Language Models (LLMs) to process natural language narratives about social interactions, extract and structure relevant information, and enable intuitive retrieval through natural language queries.

The MVP will focus on establishing the core multi-agent architecture and natural language processing capabilities, with placeholders for future email, messaging, and social media integrations that will be implemented sequentially post-MVP.

## Vision Statement

To create an intelligent assistant that seamlessly transforms unstructured social information into a structured, queryable knowledge base, enabling users to navigate their social world with greater insight and efficiency.

## Problem Statement

Modern professionals interact with hundreds of individuals across various contexts, yet struggle to effectively capture, organize, and retrieve the rich details of these interactions. Traditional solutions (contact managers, CRMs, note-taking apps) fail to handle the nuanced, context-rich nature of social information, leading to lost insights and missed opportunities.

## Solution Overview

Our system employs a multi-agent LLM architecture to:
1. **Ingest** natural language descriptions of social interactions
2. **Extract** entities (people, organizations, roles) and relationships
3. **Validate** and enrich extracted information
4. **Store** in a structured knowledge graph
5. **Retrieve** information through intuitive natural language queries

## Target Audience

- **Primary**: Business professionals, entrepreneurs, and networkers who frequently meet new people across various contexts
- **Secondary**: Researchers, journalists, and anyone who needs to maintain detailed information about their social connections

## MVP Goals & Success Metrics

### MVP Goals
1. Establish functional multi-agent LLM architecture
2. Implement core NLU and information extraction capabilities
3. Create basic data storage and retrieval system
4. Develop intuitive user interface for input and queries
5. Demonstrate end-to-end functionality with sample data

### Success Metrics
- **Accuracy**: >85% precision in entity and relationship extraction
- **Usability**: Users can successfully add and retrieve information within 2 minutes of first use
- **Performance**: Sub-3 second response time for queries
- **Reliability**: <1% error rate in core functionality
- **User Satisfaction**: >4.0/5.0 in initial user testing

## Product Architecture

### Multi-Agent LLM Architecture

The system employs a team of specialized LLMs, each with distinct responsibilities:

#### 1. Natural Language Understanding & Information Extraction Agent
- **Responsibility**: Parse unstructured input, identify entities and relationships
- **Input**: Raw natural language text
- **Output**: Structured JSON with extracted entities and relationships
- **Key Capabilities**:
  - Named Entity Recognition (NER) for people, organizations, roles
  - Relationship Extraction (RE) for professional and social connections
  - Temporal expression recognition
  - Social media handle identification

#### 2. Data Validation & Enrichment Agent
- **Responsibility**: Verify extracted information and enhance with additional context
- **Input**: Structured JSON from extraction agent
- **Output**: Validated and enriched data structure
- **Key Capabilities**:
  - Fact-checking against reliable sources
  - Data consistency validation
  - Confidence scoring for extracted information
  - Basic enrichment (organization details, role verification)

#### 3. Query Understanding & Generation Agent
- **Responsibility**: Translate natural language queries into database queries
- **Input**: User's natural language question
- **Output**: Formal database query (e.g., Cypher for graph database)
- **Key Capabilities**:
  - Intent recognition
  - Entity identification in queries
  - Complex query generation
  - Context maintenance across conversation sessions

#### 4. Response Generation Agent
- **Responsibility**: Transform query results into natural language responses
- **Input**: Structured query results
- **Output**: Fluent, contextually relevant natural language response
- **Key Capabilities**:
  - Result summarization
  - Context-aware response formatting
  - Handling of complex or multi-part queries
  - Conversational tone adaptation

### Data Storage Architecture

#### Graph Database Model
- **Nodes**: People, Organizations, Events, Locations
- **Edges**: Relationships (WORKS_AT, MET_AT, KNOWS, etc.)
- **Properties**: Attributes on nodes and edges (dates, titles, context)
- **Technology**: Neo4j or equivalent graph database

#### Schema Example
```
(Person: Felix {name: "Felix", twitter_handle: "@lefclicksave"})
-[:WORKS_AT {title: "CEO", start_date: "2023-01-01"}]->
(Organization: Think Foundation {name: "Think Foundation"})

(Person: Felix)
-[:PREVIOUSLY_WORKED_AT {end_date: "2022-12-31"}]->
(Organization: Proof {name: "Proof"})

(Person: Felix)
-[:PREVIOUSLY_WORKED_AT {end_date: "2021-06-30"}]->
(Organization: Moonbirds {name: "Moonbirds"})
```

## User Experience Flow

### Adding Information Flow
1. **Input**: User provides natural language description of social interaction
   - Example: "Today I met Felix, the CEO of the Think Foundation, he used to work at Proof and Moonbirds, and his twitter handle is @lefclicksave"
2. **Processing**: Multi-agent pipeline extracts, validates, and stores information
3. **Confirmation**: System shows extracted information for user verification
4. **Storage**: Verified information is stored in knowledge graph

### Retrieving Information Flow
1. **Query**: User asks natural language question
   - Example: "What do I know about Felix?" or "Who do I know that works at Proof?"
2. **Translation**: Query agent converts question to database query
3. **Execution**: Database query retrieves relevant information
4. **Response**: Response agent generates natural language answer
