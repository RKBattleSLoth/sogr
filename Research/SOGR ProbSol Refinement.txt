# Iterative Refinement Process

Let me follow the process you outlined with Ed:

1. Problem/Solution Doc â†’ identify gaps
2. PRD (Product Requirements Document)
3. PR/FAQ (Press Release / Frequently Asked Questions)
4. Iterate back through all three

## Step 1: Gap Analysis - Critical Questions Before Writing PRD

Before I draft the PRD, let me identify what's unclear or needs validation:

### Business Model Questions
1. **Founder pricing:** You said "free" - but will you charge for premium features later? Or stay free forever and only monetize VCs?
2. **VC pricing validation:** $500-1K/month - is this based on comparables or just guessing? Need data.
3. **Simulation tool feasibility:** Can you actually build accurate simulations with available data? Or is this vaporware?

### Technical Questions
4. **Data acquisition:** How exactly do you scrape VC data at scale? Crunchbase API is expensive. Manual curation doesn't scale.
5. **Pitch deck processing:** Founders upload PDFs - how do you extract structured data reliably? OCR? LLM parsing? What's the error rate?
6. **Simulation accuracy:** What does ">70% accuracy" even mean? How do you measure this?

### Market Questions
7. **Web3 VC count:** How many web3 VCs exist? Is 5-10 paying customers realistic or is the market too small?
8. **Founder volume:** 1,000 new web3 startups/year - source? Is this pre-seed only? Includes failed projects?
9. **Affinity penetration in web3:** You assume they're weak there - is this validated or assumption?

### Product Questions
10. **Why would founders upload pitch decks?** What's in it for them if matching is just rules-based? Seems like they're giving data for little return.
11. **Cold start problem:** You need 200 founders before VCs will pay. How do you get to 200 without any VC value prop yet?
12. **Founder retention:** They use your tool once to get VC list, then never come back. How do you create repeat usage?

### Go-to-Market Questions
13. **Your network size:** How many web3 founders do you personally know? Can you get 50 signups from your network alone?
14. **Content marketing:** "How to map web3 VC landscape" - are you prepared to become a content creator? That's a job in itself.
15. **VC sales:** You have no sales experience. Can you close $6K annual contracts? Or do you need a co-founder/partner?

### Competitive Questions
16. **What's Harmonic's revenue model?** If they're already selling VC databases to founders, aren't you just building the reverse?
17. **Why won't VCs just use LinkedIn + their network?** What's the 10x better feature that makes this a must-have vs nice-to-have?

### Execution Questions
18. **Your time commitment:** Can you dedicate 40+ hours/week to this? Or is this a side project?
19. **Runway:** How long can you work on this before needing revenue? 6 months? 12 months?
20. **Team:** Are you building this solo? Or do you have technical co-founder lined up?

## My Answers/Assumptions (for you to validate)

Let me take a stab at these so we can refine:

**1-3 (Business):** Free for founders permanently (network effects), only monetize VCs. Pricing based on competitor analysis (Harmonic is ~$100/month for founders, flip the script and charge VCs 5-10x). Simulation is hypothesis - needs validation.

**4-6 (Technical):** Manual curation for top 50 VCs (MVP), crowdsource corrections later. Pitch deck parsing with LLM (accept structured data from founders in form instead of PDF parsing initially). Simulation accuracy = "VC says conversation felt realistic" - subjective but measurable via survey.

**7-9 (Market):** ~100 active web3 VC firms (estimate). 5-10 customers = 5-10% market penetration (reasonable for Year 1). Affinity penetration unknown - needs validation calls.

**10-12 (Product):** Founders upload because matching improves over time (you refine algorithm with their data). Retention through weekly "new VCs matching your profile" emails. Cold start via your network + content.

**13-15 (GTM):** You personally know 20-30 founders (assumption), can get 50 signups, need 150 more via content/community. You'll need to learn sales or partner with someone who can.

**16-17 (Competitive):** Harmonic sells data, you sell intelligence (simulation + matching). VCs will pay because it's higher signal than random LinkedIn scraping.

**18-20 (Execution):** Assuming 20 hours/week, 12-month runway, solo founder initially.

## Should I Proceed with PRD?

Before I write a 20-page PRD, tell me:

1. **Which of these 20 questions are the biggest unknowns for you?**
2. **Which assumptions above are wrong?**
3. **What additional context should I know before drafting the PRD?**

This will ensure the PRD is grounded in reality rather than aspirational fiction.

Alternatively, if you want me to just draft the PRD with the assumptions above and we'll iterate from there, I can do that too. Your call.
